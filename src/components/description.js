        Dear Sir/Madam, Thanks for shortlisting me! I completed the assignment
        kindly refer to my GitHub repository to get the code for the same. Upon
        the completion of this assignment, I furthermore declare that I used
        only react js and JSX syntax along with react-hooks, react lifecycle,
        and styled-components. However, I made it as simple as possible and used
        some small examples to demonstrate my skills for different features of
        the react. I am so confident that I can handle any difficult task using
        react. I would be glad if I will be selected for further processes. With
        regards, Arif Fakorizada
